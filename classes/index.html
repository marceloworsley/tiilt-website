      <h1>Interactive Media and Technology for Learning</h1>
      <p>This is a hands-on project course. All students will design and implement interactive technologies for
        supporting learning. Students will be expected to do computer programming as part of this class. During
        this course, students will get a hands-on introduction to designing novel interfaces with multimodal
        sensor technology. Each week students will explore a specific modality or theory, and complete one or
        more activities that will challenge them to utilize that theory or modality. In order to support a
        strong introduction to both theory and practice, every week will include one class session involving
        hands-on work, and another that uses a seminar style to discuss theory and closely examine the assigned
        Readings. Students will be expected to use insights and ideas presented in the class in a collaborative
        final project.</p>

      <h1>Inclusive Making</h1>
      <p>Excitement for the Maker Movement continues to grow. Part of this growth stems from the idea that Making
        provides a means for democratization of fabrication and invention. While this is true, in part, the
        practices and people that are typically included under this brand are limited. In particular, issues of
        diversity, equity and inclusivity are seldom at the forefront of the design and implementation of
        Makerspaces, the tools used or the artifacts created. Hence, the purpose of this course is to bring
        issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity to the forefront. In particular, the course will push
        students to:
      </p>
      <ol class="list_with_padding">
        <li>critically explore Making as a practice that promotes democratization.</li>
        <li>develop interfaces that allow a broader population of students to participate in digital
          fabrication.</li>
        <li>co-design artifacts that positively impact accessibility and inclusivity.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The course will include guest speakers, laboratory portions and a final project that encourages students
        to develop publishable scholarship and/or functional prototypes, as they work in interdisciplinary
        teams.
