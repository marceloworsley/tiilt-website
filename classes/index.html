            <h1>Interactive Media and Technology for Learning</h1>
            <p>This is a hands-on project course. All students will design and implement interactive technologies for
                supporting learning. Students will be expected to do computer programming as part of this class. During
                this course, students will get a hands-on introduction to designing novel interfaces with multimodal
                sensor technology. Each week students will explore a specific modality or theory, and complete one or
                more activities that will challenge them to utilize that theory or modality. In order to support a
                strong introduction to both theory and practice, every week will include one class session involving
                hands-on work, and another that uses a seminar style to discuss theory and closely examine the assigned
                Readings. Students will be expected to use insights and ideas presented in the class in a collaborative
                final project.</p>

            <h1>Inclusive Making</h1>
            <p>Excitement for the Maker Movement continues to grow. Part of this growth stems from the idea that Making
                provides a means for democratization of fabrication and invention. While this is true, in part, the
                practices and people that are typically included under this brand are limited. In particular, issues of
                diversity, equity and inclusivity are seldom at the forefront of the design and implementation of
                Makerspaces, the tools used or the artifacts created. Hence, the purpose of this course is to bring
                issues of diversity, equity and inclusivity to the forefront. In particular, the course will push
                students to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>critically explore Making as a practice that promotes democratization.</li>
                <li>develop interfaces that allow a broader population of students to participate in digital
                    fabrication.</li>
                <li>co-design artifacts that positively impact accessibility and inclusivity.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The course will include guest speakers, laboratory portions and a final project that encourages students
                to develop publishable scholarship and/or functional prototypes, as they work in interdisciplinary
                teams.
