      <p class="about_words">The Technological Innovations for Inclusive Learning and Teaching (tiilt) Lab aims to improve learning opportunities for students from under-served communities. Our work with technological innovations includes: 1) co-designing activities with teachers and learners; 2) creating interfaces that broaden participation in meaningful learning experience; and 3) tools and analytic techniques for studying and supporting complex learning environments. We position our work as inclusive, in that we endeavor to address historic and contemporary disparities in inclusivity and social, racial and economic inequity. Furthermore, we work with teachers, students, community members and parents, in hope of supporting the development of positive learning ecosystems.</p>
