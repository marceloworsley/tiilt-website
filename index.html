                    <p class="description">Tangicraft is an interface to enable visually impaired individuals to play
                        Minecraft. Our design includes two main
                        components, a wearable device that allows players to haptically sense what is on the screen,
                        and a set of tangible
                        blocks which allow players to physically construct objects and place them in the game world
                        using speech commands and
                        computer vision.
