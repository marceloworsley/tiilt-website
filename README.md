# tiilt-website
the un-official tiilt website

- need to be on NU VPN to access webmin
- once you sign in go to others -> file manager
- for fonts: use .woff file format
- in image directory: everything is split up by page
- sass is a step up from css
- sass allows you to nest easier
- install node js
- instead of pages everything is split into sections
- if the div is a window it will show up as one of the info boxes (like one that holds marceloâ€™s paper)
- if you have a hidden box put the image in it
- CMS = content management system
   - could have a text file (with consistent formatting) that can add content straight to the site without having to touch the HTML
